    \caption{The three types of feature extraction networks with different strategies are: positive triangle shape, inverted triangle shape, and spindle network shape. Different lengths represent different number of channels, for example, in the Base model, the number of channels in convolutional layers 1-5 is 32, 64, 64, 128, and 256, respectively.}
