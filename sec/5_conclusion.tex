\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, wefound that the similarity of character components can be leveraged to improve the performance of tails in long-tail distribution data.
Furthermore, we also implement a spindle network to extract character component features, exploiting the similarity between character components to improve the performance of tail classes.
Experiments on three challenging Chinese ancient book datasets (TKH, MTH1000, and MTH1200) to validate the superiority of our proposed method. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in this field.

In the future, we plan to train our framework in a weakly- supervised manner, which has proven to be successful in the scene text field.
